# Python Character Picker â€“ Beginner Practice Project

This is a simple interactive Python script written as part of my beginner Python learning journey.  
It demonstrates conditional logic, user input handling, and terminal text styling using ANSI escape codes.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What this script does:
- Prompts the user with a question about their favorite book character.
- Accepts user input for a favorite character.
- Prints a different response depending on the input:
  - Recognizes `"Alice"` (case insensitive) and prints a welcome message in **blue**.
  - Recognizes variations of `"The Mad Hatter"` and prints a colorful Mad Hatter quote in **red**.
  - For all other inputs, prints a friendly fallback message.

---

## ðŸ“š Skills practiced:
- Python `input()` and `print()` functions
- Basic conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- String comparison
- Case handling with `or` and `in` statements
- ANSI escape codes for colorized terminal output:
  - `\033[34m` for blue
  - `\033[31m` for red
  - `\033[0m` to reset text color

print("I love that you love to read! Who is your favorite book character? " +
  "\033[34mAlice\033[0m, from Alice in Wonderland, or " +
  "\033[31mthe Mad Hatter?\033[0m")

favoriteBookCharacter = input("Who's your favorite Character?")

if favoriteBookCharacter == "Alice" or favoriteBookCharacter == "alice":
  print("\033[34mWelcome to Wonderland, Alice!\033[0m")
elif favoriteBookCharacter in ["the Mad Hatter", "The Mad Hatter", "Mad Hatter", "mad hatter", "the mad hatter"]:
  print("\033[31mI'm afraid so. You're entirely bonkers. But I'll tell you a secret. All the best people are.\033[0m")
else:
  print("That's a great character, too! Way to take your own path!")

## ðŸ’» Example interaction:
I love that you love to read! Who is your favorite book character? Alice, from Alice in Wonderland, or the Mad Hatter?
Who's your favorite Character? Mad Hatter
I'm afraid so. You're entirely bonkers. But I'll tell you a secret. All the best people are.
