# Colorful MadLibs Story – Python Beginner Project

This is a simple, interactive Python project where I practiced:
- User input with `input()`
- Variable assignment and reuse
- String formatting and concatenation
- ANSI escape codes for **colored terminal output**

---

## 📖 What this script does:
The script:
1️⃣ Prints a **green-colored welcome message**  
2️⃣ Prompts the user for:
- Their name
- Their pet’s name
- Their pet’s color
- Their favorite task

3️⃣ Generates a short story using the inputs, with names and key words printed in **green text** using ANSI escape codes (`\033[32m` for green, `\033[0m` to reset).
