This is a simple Python program that simulates a very basic login portal with hardcoded credentials.  
It‚Äôs part of my beginner Python learning journey and helps practice:

- User input handling
- Basic conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Simple authentication logic

---

## üí° What this script does:
- Greets the user as they "log in."
- Accepts user input for:
  - `username`
  - `password`
- Implements conditional logic to decide what welcome message to show:
  - If the username is `"admin"` and the password is `"1234"`, they see:  
    `"Welcome, admin!"`
  - If the username is `"guest"`, they see:  
    `"Welcome, guest!"` (no password required)
  - For all other inputs, the user sees:  
    `"Welcome, user!"`

---

## üìö Skills practiced:
- `input()` for user interaction
- `if`, `elif`, `else` for flow control
- Simple logical conditions (`and` operator)
- Basic understanding of authentication concepts

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run:
Run this script in a Python-capable environment (Replit, local terminal, etc.):

python3 microhard_login.py

yaml
Copy

‚≠êÔ∏è **Project purpose:**  
This is part of my **100 Days of Python journey** and demonstrates an early milestone:  
Learning how to control program flow and simulate basic decision-making.

print("Welcome to the MicroHard log-in portal.State your username and password.")
username = input("Username: ")
password = input ("Password: ")
if username == "admin" and password == "1234":
  print("Welcome, admin!")
elif username == "guest":
  print("Welcome, guest!")
else:
  print ("Welcome, user!")
