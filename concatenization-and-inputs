This logs my Python learning experience
yourName = input("What is your name?")
whatYear = input("What year is it?")
print(yourName, "thinks it is", whatYear)
I practiced various forms of inputs and concatenization. This was an example of that.
# Python Input Practice

This is a simple beginner Python script that practices getting user input and displaying output using `print()`.

## Code overview
The script:
- Asks the user for their name.
- Asks the user for the current year.
- Prints a sentence combining both inputs.

Example interaction:
What is your name? Laurine
What year is it? 2025
Laurine thinks it is 2025
